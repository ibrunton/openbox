# openbox config

This is my openbox config.  I'm currently (June 2013) running it on
Slackware64-14.0.  The `menu.xml` file is included, even though I don't use it
and haven't customised it yet.

The keybindings include several using the numeric keypad to place and size
windows in the style of the `subtle` window manager.  My workflow in openbox
remains inspired by the tiling window managers I've used (herbstluftwm, subtle,
xmonad) but I don't need the constraints of true tiling very often.
